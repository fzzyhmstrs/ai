# The Colorful Update
This update adds a lot of new colorful and fun things to play around with, some new easter eggs to find, and even some new scepters. It will also likely **be the last major content update I make on versions 1.19 through 1.19.3**

As I move forward with parting to 1.19.4 and 1.20+, I will focus my attention on those versions. I have a very foundational spell rework in the makings that will rewrite how all spells work from the core. I sadly don't think I will have the time or energy to port this gigantic undertaking to older versions.

### Port to 1.19.4

### Fixes
* Fixed the Curse recipe.
* Fixed accidental incompat with Quilted FAPI.
* Fixed secret challenge condition of the healers gem
* Fixed off-thread warning
* Fixed summoned totems falling through blocks
* Fixed Hasting recipe in patchouli book.

### Changes
* Renamed a couple spells
* Changed how Hailstorm (now Winter's Grasp) works. It's now an AOE over-time damage and freeze effect.
* Removed Summon Totem of Wit. Server Owners, I recommend you compensate any players that lose that spell as you deem fit.
* Reworked the Patchouli book some, polishing up typos and moving spells into a more sensible chapter, among other things.
* Summons now remember their owner across saves, and also remember their lifespan. They should now properly follow the owner after re-logging, and they will remove themselves even after a re-log also. Pre-existing "permanent" summons will stay permanent.
* Tweaked some spell XP-on-cast
* Changed the wit starter spells. Summon Hamster is now a starter spell, Summon Boat is no longer a starter spell.
* Aegis is now a mace.

### Additions
* Added Colored Shine Lights! Craft these lights using any dye, and they also emit particles of their corresponding colors. Combine 8 different colors to make a *Rainbow Shine Light*
* Added Colored Crystallized Light! An upgraded variant of Hard Light, they come in 16-single color variants, rather than constantly shifting color.
* Added Dazzling Melon Slice, an upgraded glistering melon that grants blessed when eaten. used as a powerful healing spell ingredient.
* Added a new Easter Egg weapon :3.
* Added two new Entities, the Hamster (it's a hamster), and the Bonestorm (it's an undead blaze)
* Added Tigers Eye, a new gem that is taking the place of Charged Moonstone. For the time being, Charged Moonstone still exists in the mod, along with a conversion recipe. In the next update, this conversion recipe and the Moonstone will be completely removed.
  * Tigers Eye is found as a very rare ore in the Nether. Added basalt and blackstone Tigers Eye Ores.
* Added three New Scepters
  * Scepter of Agonies (Negative Status Effect specialty)
  * Persuasive Scepter (Mind Control and Spell Levelling)
  * Scepter of Harvests (Farming Magic and Spell AOE)
* Added three new totem Augments
